# Install the Arca marketing skills (no coding needed)

You don't need to know any commands. You just ask your AI agent (ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, Codex…) to fetch the files for you.

---

## The easy way — paste this to your AI agent

Copy everything between the lines and send it to your agent:

```
Please install the Arca marketing skills into this environment.

1. Download every folder inside the "skills/" directory of this public GitHub repo:
   https://github.com/aobalitaan/arca-marketing/tree/main/skills

2. Place each of those folders so it sits DIRECTLY inside my agent's skills folder
   (exactly one level deep — folder name, then SKILL.md inside it). Use the folder for my tool:
     • Claude / Claude Code  ->  .claude/skills/
     • Cursor                ->  .cursor/skills/
     • Codex                 ->  .agents/skills/
   If you are ChatGPT in a sandbox without a skills folder, just keep the files in the
   working directory and follow each SKILL.md as instructions when I ask.

3. IMPORTANT: also copy the "_arca-marketing-assets" folder into the same skills folder,
   right next to the skill folders. Every skill reads the brand profile and assets from it.

4. When done, list the skills you installed and tell me to start with "arca-marketing".
```

That's it. Then say **"use the arca-marketing skill"** (or "where do I start?") and it walks you through the rest.

## What you just installed

Seven folders land in your skills folder:

- `arca-marketing` — **start here**; orients you and points to the right skill
- `brand-builder` — Q&A that writes your brand profile
- `design-guide` — generates your brand identity board
- `carousel-generator` — Instagram/LinkedIn carousels
- `storyboard-prompt` — pressure-tests a video idea into a production board
- `video-prompt` — turns the board into an AI video
- `shorts-editor` — cuts/captions footage into a finished short

…plus `_arca-marketing-assets/` (the shared brand profile + logo/images the skills read).

---

## Alternative installs (if you're comfortable with a terminal)

- **Skills CLI:** `npx skills add aobalitaan/arca-marketing`
- **In-chat:** install the `/learn` command, then `/learn @aobalitaan/arca-marketing`
- **npm (Claude Code):** `npx arca-marketing-video` (copies the skills into `.claude/skills/`)
- **Manual:** clone the repo and copy the contents of `skills/` into your `.claude/skills/` folder.

## First steps after installing
1. Say **"use arca-marketing"** — it explains the kit.
2. Run **`brand-builder`** to set up your brand.
3. Then make content: `carousel-generator`, or `storyboard-prompt → video-prompt → shorts-editor`.
